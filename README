Author(s)       EleotleCram
MediaWiki       1.9 (maybe older versions too)

Installing

Copy the Dia directory into the extensions folder of your MediaWiki installation. Then add the following lines to your LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

require_once( "$IP/extensions/Dia/Dia.php" );

Configuration

$wgDIANominalSize
    The nominal width of a Dia file when rendered to png (default: 300px).

$wgDIAMaxSize
    Don't scale a Dia file larger than this (default: 1024px).

Advanced Configuration

Dia diagrams may be uploaded as drawings. these diagrams are converted to png before they can be rendered on a page. An external program is required to perform this conversion. By default 'dia' itself is used to perform this conversion, but if you have a different tool to perform the conversion you can set it up here.

$wgDIAConverters
    An associative array linking your conversion tool (as key) with the commandline to be used for your tool. In this commandline you can use the following variables:

    * $input: The input filename
    * $output: The output filename
    * $width: The output width

$wgDIAConverter
    The currently selected converter (default: 'dia').
$wgDIAConverterPath
    If the currently selected converter is not in the default PATH environment variable, you can set the path here.

Note: Future versions of the extension may also output SVG.
